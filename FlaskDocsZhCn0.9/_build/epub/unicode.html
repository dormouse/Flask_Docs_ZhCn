<h1>Unicode in Flask</h1>
<p>Flask like Jinja2 and Werkzeug is totally Unicode based when it comes to
text.  Not only these libraries, also the majority of web related Python
libraries that deal with text.  If you don&#8217;t know Unicode so far, you
should probably read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer
Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets</a><span class="link-target"> [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html]</span>.  This part of the
documentation just tries to cover the very basics so that you have a
pleasant experience with Unicode related things.</p>
<div class="section" id="automatic-conversion">
<h2>Automatic Conversion</h2>
<p>Flask has a few assumptions about your application (which you can change
of course) that give you basic and painless Unicode support:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the encoding for text on your website is UTF-8</li>
<li>internally you will always use Unicode exclusively for text except
for literal strings with only ASCII character points.</li>
<li>encoding and decoding happens whenever you are talking over a protocol
that requires bytes to be transmitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what does this mean to you?</p>
<p>HTTP is based on bytes.  Not only the protocol, also the system used to
address documents on servers (so called URIs or URLs).  However HTML which
is usually transmitted on top of HTTP supports a large variety of
character sets and which ones are used, are transmitted in an HTTP header.
To not make this too complex Flask just assumes that if you are sending
Unicode out you want it to be UTF-8 encoded.  Flask will do the encoding
and setting of the appropriate headers for you.</p>
<p>The same is true if you are talking to databases with the help of
SQLAlchemy or a similar ORM system.  Some databases have a protocol that
already transmits Unicode and if they do not, SQLAlchemy or your other ORM
should take care of that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-golden-rule">
<h2>The Golden Rule</h2>
<p>So the rule of thumb: if you are not dealing with binary data, work with
Unicode.  What does working with Unicode in Python 2.x mean?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>as long as you are using ASCII charpoints only (basically numbers,
some special characters of latin letters without umlauts or anything
fancy) you can use regular string literals (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'Hello</span> <span class="pre">World'</span></tt>).</li>
<li>if you need anything else than ASCII in a string you have to mark
this string as Unicode string by prefixing it with a lowercase <cite>u</cite>.
(like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u'Hänsel</span> <span class="pre">und</span> <span class="pre">Gretel'</span></tt>)</li>
<li>if you are using non-Unicode characters in your Python files you have
to tell Python which encoding your file uses.  Again, I recommend
UTF-8 for this purpose.  To tell the interpreter your encoding you can
put the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">-*-</span> <span class="pre">coding:</span> <span class="pre">utf-8</span> <span class="pre">-*-</span></tt> into the first or second line of
your Python source file.</li>
<li>Jinja is configured to decode the template files from UTF-8.  So make
sure to tell your editor to save the file as UTF-8 there as well.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="encoding-and-decoding-yourself">
<h2>Encoding and Decoding Yourself</h2>
<p>If you are talking with a filesystem or something that is not really based
on Unicode you will have to ensure that you decode properly when working
with Unicode interface.  So for example if you want to load a file on the
filesystem and embed it into a Jinja2 template you will have to decode it
from the encoding of that file.  Here the old problem that text files do
not specify their encoding comes into play.  So do yourself a favour and
limit yourself to UTF-8 for text files as well.</p>
<p>Anyways.  To load such a file with Unicode you can use the built-in
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">str.decode()</span></tt> method:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">read_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">charset</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;utf-8&#39;</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;r&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">charset</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To go from Unicode into a specific charset such as UTF-8 you can use the
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">unicode.encode()</span></tt> method:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">write_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">contents</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">charset</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;utf-8&#39;</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;w&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">contents</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">charset</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuring-editors">
<h2>Configuring Editors</h2>
<p>Most editors save as UTF-8 by default nowadays but in case your editor is
not configured to do this you have to change it.  Here some common ways to
set your editor to store as UTF-8:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Vim: put <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">enc=utf-8</span></tt> to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.vimrc</span></tt> file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Emacs: either use an encoding cookie or put this into your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.emacs</span></tt>
file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
(setq default-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Notepad++:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to <em>Settings -&gt; Preferences ...</em></li>
<li>Select the &#8220;New Document/Default Directory&#8221; tab</li>
<li>Select &#8220;UTF-8 without BOM&#8221; as encoding</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also recommended to use the Unix newline format, you can select
it in the same panel but this is not a requirement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
